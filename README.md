## üëã Introduction
Hi there! I'm BEMELON, computer engineering graduate with a keen interest in backend engineering.
I thrive on challenges, particularly those that expand my knowledge and involve innovative uses of technology to solve practical problems.

Interested in collaborating? Feel free to [email me](mailto:dodo@bemelon.me) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bemelon/).


## üîç Interested In
I am actively looking to engage with projects involving:
- **Kotlin Ecosystem**: I'm currently immersed in learning Kotlin, a statically typed language that offers the flexibility of Python. I resonate with the diverse ecosystem Kotlin fosters and am eager to participate in various projects within this space.
- **Obsidian**: I'm inspired by Obsidian's philosophy and am actively using it to develop my own [wiki](https://blog.bemelon.me). I have a keen interest in the plugin ecosystem and am looking for projects to get involved with.
